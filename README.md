# w3po
w3PO is a simple and lightweight app to count words. Just insert any text you like and get the amount of words in it as a result.

# Installation
Install Python, verion 2.7.x should be fine, I used Python 3.6.5.
`pip3 install django==2.1.3`
Go to the folder with the clone or downloaded files where the `manage.py`is. There, use the command `python manage.py runserver`to start the app on localhost:8000.
