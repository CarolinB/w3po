# w3po
w3PO is a simple and lightweight app to count words. Just insert any text you like and get the amount of words in it as a result.

# Installation
w3PO is based on Django 2.1.3. Python version 2.7.x should be fine, I guess, I was using Python 3.6.5.
In your clone folder run `python manage.py runserver`to start the app on localhost:8000.

# Licence
No licence required, free to use.
